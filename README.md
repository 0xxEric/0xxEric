Hi, I’m Eric, a blockchain and zero-knowledge proof (ZK) enthusiast. I focus on ZK technologies like Plonk, FRI, STARK,CircleSTARK,zkVM,and others, with coding experience in FFT algorithms, Lookup arguments, and Lasso protocols. 
Half a year ago,, I worked as a product manager and electrical engineer, but my passion for decentralization led me to explore ZK technologies. Through blogs, hackathons, and projects like CircleFFT, I combine technical depth with practical implementation. Let’s connect and collaborate!
Here is my technical sharing content.
